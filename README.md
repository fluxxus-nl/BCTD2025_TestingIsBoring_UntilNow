## Session abstract
If you want quality, you need tests. If you want maintainability, you need tests. If you want...

Okay, okay, we get it, tests are great... But they’re also boring... 🙄

Well, what if we brought a breath of fresh air into them? Because that’s exactly what happened in the last 12 months. First, page scripting. Click, click, boom! Test Automated! Much simpler! And now another addition “Data-Driven Testing”. Build one AL test but cover multiple test cases! Less coding, more coverage! Fun!

Well … maybe not “fun”, but it’s something new and exciting! So if you’d like to know what these new testing practices are, and how you can “slot” them along your traditional AL tests, Join this session when we deep dive into all nuts and bolts of both new features.
